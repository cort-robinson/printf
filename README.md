## About ##

This project is an attempt to recreate the standard C builtin function printf(). It returns the number of characters printed and writes to stdout. Developing the printf function from scratch was a fun and engaging experience that put our knowledge of C and our ability to learn and code on fly to the test.

## Features ##

Handles the following specifiers:\
d\
i\
c\
s\
%\
